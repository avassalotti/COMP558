Given that the surface motion equation \cite{moler2003nineteen} for $\phi$ is
defined as a partial differential equation, we can solve it using iterative
schemes for PDEs. As most differential equations which might appear fairly
innocuous at first, solving them numerically can be quite challenging.

Given an initial value $\phi_0$, our first intution might be to apply the
first-order Euler method as follows:
\begin{align}
  \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} + F \|\nabla \phi\| &= 0 \\
  \frac{\phi^{t+1} - \phi^{t}}{\Delta t} &=  -F \|\nabla \phi\| \\
  \phi^{t+1} &= \phi^{t} - \Delta t \; F \|\nabla \phi\| 
\end{align}

However, not only does the Euler method often suffers from stability problems,
it is used in the context of \textit{ordinary differential equations}, not
PDEs. In that case, a different numerical procedure is needed.  One approach
defined for the initial value formulation by Sethian is called the
